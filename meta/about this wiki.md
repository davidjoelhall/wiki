This wiki is a public knowledgebase of what I know, find interesting, and things I'm currently doing. Kudos to [Nikita Voloboev](https://nikitavoloboev.xyz) for sharing [their setup and meta details](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/), I've used a similar method to put [this](/meta/services.md) together.
