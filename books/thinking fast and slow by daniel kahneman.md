### Principle of Diminishing Sensitivity 

Turning on a weak light in dark room compared to weak light in bright room 
Perceived value when comparing the difference of a 90% increase in salary: 900 increase salary on 1000, compared to a 11% increase in salary: 900 increase on 10000 salary. In both situations, you're increasing your salary by the same... but in the former, it's a large change percentage wise. 

### <unknown principle> 

The difference in goods that are *held for use* vs. *held for exchange*. 

Held for use: wine for drinking, sold out super bowl tickets

Held for exchange: money for shoes

You could sell your super bowl tickets for a large sum over your purchase price, but if you can't get them again and you bought them for use -- your likeliness to sell is low. Compare this to if you purchased tickets with the intention to sell.
